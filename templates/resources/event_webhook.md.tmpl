**Important Notes:**

- There is only one event webhook per SendGrid account (or subuser)
- The webhook cannot be deleted, only disabled
- Event types require specific tracking settings to be enabled:
  - `open` and `click` events require Open Tracking and Click Tracking
  - `unsubscribe`, `group_resubscribe`, and `group_unsubscribe` require Subscription Tracking
- Use `friendly_name` to help identify your webhook (available in SendGrid dashboard)
- OAuth authentication is optional but recommended for enhanced security
- Signature verification can be enabled for webhook request verification

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/sendgrid_event_webhook/resource.tf" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

3. Use the `public_key` (computed) for webhook payload verification
